# **Tutorial: How to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`

Hey guys, today I will being showing you (CSE 15L student) how to log into `ieng6`!

## Step 1:

Find your course specific account by going to this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and looking up your account. Your account name should be by the format `cs15lwi23abc` with `abc` being some unique characters. You will also need to set up your password with the password reset tool. Be careful not to replace your main password!

## Step 2:

Next, you are going to want to download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It should look like this once you have followed through the setup instuctions.

## Step 3:

Now that you have VSCode installed as well as your account obtained, it is time to remotely connect. First, download [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Then, in VSCode open up your Terminal (Press Ctrl + \` or click "Terminal" on the top and "New Terminal"). In the Terminal, type `ssh cs15lwi23abc@ieng6.ucsd.edu` but make sure you replace the `abc` with your unique characters. Now, a prompt should pull up and you should type "yes". It is going to ask you for your password that you created. 

**Important things to note:** You can't see what you are typing because it is a security measure. Make sure you have given the system enough time to register your password. 

Once you are in, it should look like this in your Terminal.

## Step 4:

You're in! Now you can mess around by trying some commands. 

To log out, you can press Ctrl + D or type `exit` into the Terminal.
